# Additional analyses

## RMT after stimulation (time=3) compared to baseline (time=1), both for real (VNS=2) and sham (VNS=1).

We can claim with 71% +/- 1% that RMT post stimulation is higher than baseline in the real condition.

For sham we can claim the opposite with 59% +/- 1% (the same can be claimed with 41%).

We can claim with 67% +/- 1% that the difference between post and baseline in real condition is higher than in sham condition.

## AUC = 1/3*(CS70%+CS90%) + 1/3*(CS80%+CS100%) + 1/3*(CS90%+CS100%)

AUC:
real stim < 0: 95%
sham stim < 0: 1%
real stim < sham stim: 99%

AUC3:
real stim < 0: 96.28% +/- 0.33%
sham stim < 0: 1.2% +/- 0.29%
real stim < sham stim: 99.83% +/- 0.1%
